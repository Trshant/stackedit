Description : "Ledgers - the logic behind it."

Well, I am here to write about everyday old fashioned ledgers. Investopedia has a seriously great set of articles on the same [^investopedia] . i might be simplifying things here. I am an engineer by trade and may have got a few concepts/ideas wrong here. Do please forgive me for them.

So, ledgers are those things that keep an account of your business's financial dealings and which, at the end of the year or whenever-you-please can give you an idea of how you are doing financially. It is also something that is a zero-sum procress and involves writing things off in 2 different places so ledger's balance sheet actually balances out.
