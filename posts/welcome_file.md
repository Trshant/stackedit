Today i shall write of map reduce.
This is really great to use to do some massive computations using some primitive building blocks.
Map reduce comprises of 2 steps:
  1  - Map 
  2  - Reduce
What do these terms mean, though? why is it so popular? is this worth the pain? For answering these questions and raising a few more, please read on.
The process of mapReduce is from functional programming, where any function does not have side effects, an unintended . 
Map is a process where, essentially, we process each bit of data
