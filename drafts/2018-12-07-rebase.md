This bit ( in different word ) is written in repos sometimes where there has been some very heavy rewrites. very heavy, like that have changed the file/folder structure or the underlying frameowork. So what does rebase do?
This simply changes the history to what you want it to be. This is a way to change the history and base the branch you are working on, on the branch you want the work on yours, without checout out the code.
This is also a way to disregard the code changes till now.

Read the 2 links in the references. They have a lot of information on __rebase__.
