Since I heard about webASsembly, i have been enthralled by it. So i did some investigating on my own as to WA being faster than JavaScript. 
In short, wheat i did was follow ([https://medium.freecodecamp.org/get-started-with-webassembly-using-only-14-lines-of-javascript-b37b6aaca1e4](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/get-started-with-webassembly-using-only-14-lines-of-javascript-b37b6aaca1e4))

In conclusion, i agree with [Lemire's](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/10/23/is-webassembly-faster-than-javascript/) conclusions and think that well written javascript will be faster than webassembly at this moment, May 2019.
