These are my sprints for the week 28/01/19 -  01/02/2019

### neural network
These are some of the things i want to try out using neural networks.

1. Multiply things using nns and see if they work.  
2. Multiple things with/without carry and then see if that works.  
3. Scale multiplication up using those same models.  

While it does not seem like much, it could boost my understanding and take away what i right now consider as magic. It will also allow me to understand how scale could easily be achieved using this.

### React  
  
I want to understand state and how to use it. while simple, this is what is stopping me from understanding react properly.

---
### Node 

understanding sequelize models. This will give me a good understanding of how i would want my models to feel like. And also i will be able to figure out how to build my apps

---
### typescript

I want to understand how the whole thing comes together,
