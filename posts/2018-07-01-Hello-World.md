I have moved my entire blogging to github pages. I am using Hugo, a delightfully simple static file generator.

I plan on using a small cron on the raspberry pi to post stuff to my trshant.github.io site......atleast thats what i think.

    function hello(){
        console.log("hello world!");
    }
