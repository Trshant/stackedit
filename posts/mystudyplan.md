I usually have a study plan in place for a period of 6 months. While the previous 3 have gone according to plan, they have been mostly private. This time around, I am making this public.  
For the next 6 months, i am planning only career progression. This means even though i love to learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence, i am going to learn more how i can be good at my profession. This means i will need to get better on 3 fronts.  
  1.  At the language I am going to work in.
  2.  At the surrounding tools in the dev environment.
  3.  At communication.  
  
Let me details things out a bit now. Lets get the communication bits out of the way:
1. I want to become better at negotiation. This involves getting a thick skin and also being calm and rational. This also needs me to switch perspectives to see what the othe person wants and then, to evaluate the situation completely.
2. I want to get better at listening to people, so that i am actually listening, not assuming things.
3. I need to learn to network. This is something which involves being likeable, genuine and interested. 

Now i will look at the surrounding tools I need to learn:
1. I need to know how to use and misuse the text editor to become better at tracking everything that needs tracking. And write notes to refer to.
2. I need to learn a language to automate things that will make life easy. Python is it.
3. I want to learn bash, so I can utilise the goodness of the commandline to make my life good- this is also a rare skill and will put me head and shoulders above the rest.
4. Docker - this is something i definitely need to learn. 

Language:
Whichever language I learn or use, I need to read up specifically on it, for 10 minutes a day, so that I know what is going on in that world/ecosystem.
 
 update ( 15th October 2018 ) :
 I am going to relearn ML. not ML as a subject, but to learn how to use ML as a engineer who can take things to production.

My wife picked up this book on  Data Science. David Natingga's Data Science Algorithms in a week. I am going to write down the few algorithms it showcases:
1. [ ] K Nearest Neighbour
2. [ ] Naive Bayes
3. [ ] Decision Trees { reading list : [ [Ch.3 Decision trees](https://web.archive.org/web/20181031051556/https://medium.com/machine-learning-101/chapter-3-decision-trees-theory-e7398adac567) , [Decision trees in ML](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-trees-in-machine-learning-641b9c4e8052)  ] }
4. [ ] Random Forest
5. [ ] Clustering into K clusters
6. [ ] Regression
7. [ ] Time Series Analysis  

Other links to read from:
- [ ] [basics of genetic algorithms](https://iq.opengenus.org/basics-of-genetic-algorithms/)
Lets me see if i can do some thing along these lines. The objective of my study is to understand these topic atleast roughly to see how these can be built to scale.

**Plan Change!** ( 28th October 2018 )
 I spoke to my boss and he laid a plan out for me. This covers a lot of ends so it should open a lot of doors open for me. Plan follows...
 
 Javascript
I am using this [collection of links](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts). Found this during the hacktober fest and it is truly awesome!
   - [x] [A small recap/study](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
   - [x] [something advanced (and some fun!) ](https://johnresig.com/apps/learn/)
   - [ ] Closures  
   - [ ] Prototype  
[ES6](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/es6/index.htm)  
    - [ ] Classes, modules, const, let  
    - [ ] promises  
    - [ ] async, await  
    - [ ] arrow functions  
    - [ ] imports / exports  
Node  
    - [ ] Use Yarn  
    - [ ] fs , path  
Express  
MongoDB / Mongoose  
ReactJS  
  
The idea here is to start coding in functional programming - After this i can start coding ML in python and ( hopefully! ) position myself as a ML production engineer as well as as a full stack MEAN developer.
Along with this, i want to get into the AWS ecosystem, starting off with the [essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/essentials/) thru to [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/devops-engineering/).
