Well, I am here to write about everyday old fashioned ledgers. Investopedia has a seriously great set of articles on the same [^investopedia] . i might be simplifying things here. I am an engineer by trade and may have got a few things wrong here

So, ledgers are those things that keep an account of your business's financial dealings and which, at the end of the year or whenever-you-please can give you an idea of how you are doing financially. It is also something that is a zero-sum procress and involves writing things off in 2 different places so ledgers balance sheet actually balances out.
