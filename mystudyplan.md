I usually have a study plan in place for a period of 6 months. While the previous 3 have gone according to plan, they have been mostly private. This time around, I am making this public.  
For the next 6 months, i am planning only career progression. This means even though i love to learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence, i am going to learn more how i can be good at my profession. This means i will need to get better on 3 fronts.  
  1.  At the language i am going to work in.
  2.  At the surrounding tools in the dev environment.
  3.  At communication.  
  
Let me details things out a bit now.
