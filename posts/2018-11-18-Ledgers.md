Well, I am here to write about everyday old fashioned ledgers. Investopedia has a seriously set of articles on the same [^investopedia] .

So, ledgers are those things that keep an account of your business and which, at the end of the year or whenever-you-please can give you an idea of how you are doing financially. It is also something that is a zero-sum procress and involves writing things off in 2 different places so thing balance out.
