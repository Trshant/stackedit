i was having a word with my friend Karthik - I value his suggestions and look up to him for inspiration.

As we were talking about our respective issues/problems we were looking at problems solving for our respective organisations.
Normally we ask about things this way - What? How? Why?. But normally what happens is that by the time we are done with the What and how, 
we have forgotten about the why, and that is the most important question of all.   
So we should ask the same questions in another order- Why? What? How? By the time the first 2 questions are answered, the how will be 
answered.
