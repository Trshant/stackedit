New blog post on web componentsWeb components are a way to define custom HTML elements. These are reusable and since, they can be all custom JavaScript, can be shared as an  npm package. 
Now we have a few concepts to understand here:
 1. **Document fragment**: This is the part of the HTML that never shows up rendered on the screen.  This is where the templates will lie before they are used.
 2. **Shadow Dom**: This is the part of HTML that never will render on the screen. Document fragments will be in this. As a developer, thats all we will need to know.
 3. **JavaScript web component APIs**. This link will be explain this much better than I ever will [^atGoogle].
