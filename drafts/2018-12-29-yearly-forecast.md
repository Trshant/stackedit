this will have my forecast for the coming year.

so this time my forecast will have to be the maturing of machine learning. the years update has not been much progress, this will change to include small data, where learning will be including per person rather than the public.
 there is also an understanding of human needs that will be a big part of ml and ai. this would make a lot of changes for people and personalisation would be resulting in huge changes in app look , feel and behaviour.

industries will benefit from serious ai learning where changes in process will not mean risking what is current but that which is flexible. this could bring a sea change in adoption because of lower total ownership costs.

as people are more drawn to their cellphones than ever, there will be people who will want to stay away from their phones. we might see a resurgence of the hippie movement. However I am very sure this would too be serviced by a clich√©d service for them too. 

politically, I can see a growing unrest in the populatiin. the adoption of bitcoin was only a hint of this. I completely see how hyderlocalisation could actually be a real thing with bartering being back in the world. this, however is an extreme reaction. the more sober ones could be startups that deal with food gardens at home. 

I also see a market starting for devices that are alternate computing devices - like raspberry, arduino derived devices.
