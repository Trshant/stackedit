Do Read through AWS in simple english[^awsSimpleLanguage] to figure out what we are going to do here. What we are trying to accomplish is simply to host a static site.
This involves us:
- Setting up the server.
- Making sure that the outer world has access to our server.
- Ensuring FTP access is enabled (so that we can upload files to the server).
- Accessing the site.

TODO: install PHP mysql after getting shell access.
